# Avatar Videos for GuideMind

## Required Video Files for HeyGen or D-ID

For your hackathon presentation, you'll need to create and add the following video files:

1. **avatar-idle.mp4** - An idle state video where the avatar is looking at the camera with slight natural movements
2. **avatar-speaking.mp4** - A video of the avatar speaking (can be a generic "I'm explaining" clip)
3. **avatar-listening.mp4** - A video showing the avatar in a listening pose (head slightly tilted, attentive)

## How to Create These Videos

### Using HeyGen:
1. Go to [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/)
2. Create 3 short clips with the same avatar in different states
3. Download the videos and rename them according to the filenames above
4. Place them in this directory

### Using D-ID:
1. Go to [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/)
2. If you want to use a custom image, upload it to create your avatar
3. Create 3 short clips as described above
4. Download and rename them according to the filenames above
5. Place them in this directory

## Screenshot for Poster Image

Also take a screenshot from the idle video and save it as:
- `/static/img/avatar-poster.jpg`

This will be used as the poster frame for the video element when the page first loads.

## Note on File Types

If MP4 format doesn't work well, you can also use:
- WebM format (.webm)
- Ogg format (.ogg)

Just make sure to update the video source in the HTML accordingly.
