For your hackathon:

1. Download a HeyGen/D-ID avatar video clip for:
   - Idle state (looking at camera, slight movements)
   - Speaking state (talking to camera)

2. Place them in the static/video directory as:
   - avatar-idle.mp4
   - avatar-speaking.mp4

3. Take a screenshot from one of these videos and save it in static/img as:
   - avatar-poster.jpg

This will make your avatar look professional during your hackathon presentation.
