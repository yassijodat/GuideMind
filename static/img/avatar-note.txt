For your hackathon:

1. Take a screenshot from your HeyGen or D-ID avatar video
2. Save it as "avatar-poster.jpg" in this directory
3. This will be used as the initial image shown before the avatar video plays

If you don't have time to create this file, the application will still work without it, but may show a blank space initially.
